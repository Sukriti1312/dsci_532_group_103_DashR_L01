## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

All participants in our communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all DSCI 532 projects, events and platforms:

1. Use welcoming and inclusive language
2. Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
3. Gracefully accept constructive criticism
4. Focus on what is best for the community
5. Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

## Unacceptable Behavior
1. Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
2. Causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
3. Violent threats or language directed against another person
the display of sexual or violent images
unwelcome sexual attention
4. Nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
insults or put downs
5. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
6. continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop publication of private communication without consent

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any DSCI 532 events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the teaching team may warn the offender and or engage the DSCI 532 Instructor to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.

## Incident Reporting Guidelines

If someone violates the Code of Conduct during a DSCI 532 event we ask that you report it to a member of the teaching team in person.  If this is not possible for some reason, we would be very grateful if you could report the incident by emailing to firas.moosvi@ubc.ca. An alternative contact person is Bruce Dunham, Professor of Teaching in the Department of Statistics at UBC. His email is b.dunham@stat.ubc.ca
